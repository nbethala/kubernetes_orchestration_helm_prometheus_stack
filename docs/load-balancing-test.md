# ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancing Test: Kubernetes Service Distribution

This document captures a manual test of load balancing behavior in a Kubernetes cluster using a multi-replica deployment and a ClusterIP service.

---

## üß™ Test Setup

- **Deployment Name**: `my-webapp`
- **Replicas**: 5
- **Service Type**: ClusterIP
- **Goal**: Validate that traffic is evenly distributed across pods

## üì¶ Deployment & Service Configuration

### Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-webapp
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-webapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-webapp
          image: my-webapp:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80


## **Service**

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-webapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP


## **Load balancing test **
Step 1: Get Service IP
kubectl get svc my-webapp-service

Step 2: Send Repeated Requests
for i in {1..20}; do curl http://<cluster-ip>/; done
Note: Each pod should return a unique identifier (e.g., hostname or pod name) to confirm traffic distribution.

## **STAR Method: Load Balancing Validation **

**Situation**
A multi-replica web application was deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. The goal was to validate internal load balancing behavior using a ClusterIP service.

**Task**
Ensure that incoming traffic is evenly distributed across all running pods and that the service routes requests reliably.

**Action**
Deployed my-webapp with 5 replicas

Exposed it via a ClusterIP service

Sent repeated requests to the service IP

Verified responses from multiple pods

Monitored pod logs and service events

**Result**
Traffic was successfully distributed across all pods

No single pod was overloaded

Service routing was consistent and reliable

Demonstrated Kubernetes‚Äô internal load balancing capabilities
